      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        The assignment is to implement the <strong>mySearchFn</strong> function.
        This function is called whenever the input search term changes, and is
        used to populate the searchResults, which then get re-rendered. The items to
        search through are in a small array in the SearchData variable, and they do
        not change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shape of the return value of the function is like this (say the search
        term is "jou"):</p>
      <pre>
        [{value: "Journal Batch", matches [{start: 0, end: 3}]},
        {value: "Journal Entry", matches: [{start: 0, end: 3}]}
        ...
        ]
      </pre>
      <p>
        The return array should be sorted so that the most relevant results are
        first, then alphabetically. Relevancy is established and ranked by its
        position on this list:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Exact Matches</li>
        <li>Matches at the beginning</li>
        <li>Matches at the end</li>
        <li>Partial beginning of word match ("jo en" would match
          "Journal Entry List")</li>
        <li>Matches in the middle</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Some conflicts wouldn't be completely clear how to resolve just from that
        list (E.g., what would win, a beginning match of "J", or an ending match
        of "Batch"?), so you'll have to use your judgement to think what would be
        intuitive for users.
      </p>

      <h4>Rules</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Only your own code, working by yourself</li>
        <li>Utility libraries like lodash, Ramda, etc are ok, but no other
          libraries.</li>
        <li>Ok to use other languages supported by Codepen, like CoffeeScript</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Guidelines/tips</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Only care about the <strong>mySearchFn</strong> function - not css,
          etc</li>
        <li>It may be easier to return try filtering the results without providing
          the matches array initially.</li>  
      </ol>
